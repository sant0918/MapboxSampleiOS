The following table lists the different call result codes that may be returned
by the API and the corresponding descriptions.

These codes only describe the result of the phone call and not whether
authentication was successful or failed.  A call result value will always be
returned regardless of whether a call is made or not and whether the Multi-Factor
Authentication succeeds or fails.  These codes are mainly useful for
troubleshooting issues with the SDK integration and wouldn't be used for
programmatic logic following an authentication request.
